Functions are often used to \"abstract away\" complicated code into a single call to make code more readable and easier to understand. Here is an example of a function that lets you perform the math operation 2*x + 3*y on a set of an input x and y.\n"

    "- Use functions whenever you have a block of code you expect to reuse repetitively\n",
    "- Keep the purpose of you function to handle one task\n",
    "- Keep the number of parameters for a function low so it is easy for you and other people looking at the code to know how many parameters are needed to pass in and in what order\n",
    "- Name the funcion something meaningful so it is easy to read and easy for end users to figure out the purpose. This goes for variables also. Follow the pep8 style guide (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)\n",
    "- Include a docstring that explains the inputs, outputs, and purpose of the function\n",
    "- If you really want to be fancy, include type hints to designate the type that the inputs and outputs are (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)\n"
