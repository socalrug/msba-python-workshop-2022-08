## Schedule
### Thursday August 3: Python Fundamentals

The focus will be on Python as a language, drawing from the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/).

* Session 1: Using Python, VSCode and Jupyter Notebooks
    * What is a notebook, why are they useful?
    * JupyterLab interface
    * Working with cells (creating, executing, cell types, etc)
    * Tips and best practices
* Session 2: Review of Python Fundamentals
    * Importance of spacing
    * Expressions and variables
    * Math operations
    * Data types (numbers, strings, boolean)
    * Lists
* Session 3: Control Flows
    * Conditional statements
    * Loops
* Session 4: Functions
    * What are they and why are they important
    * Function syntax
    * How to write your own functions
    * Tips and best practices

### Friday August 4: Applied Data Science Fundamentals with `pandas`

The focus will be on Pandas as the entry into data science specific tasks, drawing from the [getting started tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html).

* Session 5: Introduction to `pandas`
    * Why tabular data tables are useful for data science (compare to Excel)
    * Series and DataFrames
    * How to create Series and DataFrames
    * How to read Series and DataFrames from files
* Session 6: Subsetting `DataFrames`
    * Selecting columns
    * Filtering rows
    * The various ways of indexing data frames (by labels, slices, conditional expressions), `loc` and `iloc`
* Session 7: Reshaping and Merging `DataFrames`
    * Wide vs. long formats and converting between the two: pivot and melt
    * Grouped summaries, `groupby`
    * Concatenating tables by column and row: `concat`
    * Joining data tables: `merge`
* Session 8: Data Visualization with `pandas`
    * Basic plotting from pandas: `plot`, `scatter`, `box`, `hist`, etc
    * Examples of more complex plots, coloring and grouping by variables
    * Tuning plot parameters (sizes, colors, layouts)
    * Saving plots (e.g. to use in presentations, etc)
